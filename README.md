# MOD4B_project
# PROBLEM 8.
Write a program in Java that implements a “slice” of iBank. This slice must include all the
major use cases of iBank. The purpose of the program is to serve as a proof-of-concept for
design.

Your program must follow a ‘standard’ programming style for Java. Your program must have a graphical user interface (GUI), using either Java Swing or JavaFX. Your program must have explicit support for handling exceptions.

The exceptional behaviors of iBank must be accompanied by corresponding error messages, as appropriate. The error messages should aim to be helpful to a user of iBank.

Problem 8 should be informed by Problem 7.
# PROBLEM 9.
Test iBank using representative sample data.
